# Tutti

[![CI](https://github.com/dqsjqian/Tutti/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/dqsjqian/Tutti/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A modern C++23 thread pool.

Tutti gives you a fixed pool of worker threads and a clean, exception-safe API for
running work on them. It is the successor to an older C++11 thread pool and is
built on the modern C++ threading vocabulary: `std::jthread`, `std::stop_token`,
`std::move_only_function` and `std::expected`.

```cpp
#include <tutti/thread_pool.hpp>

tutti::ThreadPool pool;                                  // one worker per CPU core
auto answer = pool.submit([] { return 42; });           // runs on a worker
std::println("answer = {}", answer.get());              // 42
```

## Highlights

- **Header only.** One file, no dependencies beyond the C++23 standard library.
- **C++23 first.** The task queue is a move-only callable (`std::move_only_function`
  where the standard library has it), refusals are reported with `std::expected`,
  and pool statistics drop straight into `std::format`.
- **No busy waiting.** Every wait goes through a condition variable, including
  `wait()`, which used to spin on an atomic counter.
- **No per-task indirection.** A `std::packaged_task` is moved straight into the
  queue: no `shared_ptr`, no atomic refcount, no extra allocation per submission.
- **Real futures.** `submit()` returns a `std::future`, and an exception thrown by
  a task is delivered through it instead of killing the worker.
- **Accepts everything callable.** Free functions, lambdas, functors, member
  function pointers and move-only callables all work.
- **Backpressure.** `Options::max_pending` bounds the queue; `try_submit()` reports
  `PoolError::queue_full` instead of growing without limit.
- **Bulk work.** `parallel_for()` and `parallel_for_each()` split a range into one
  chunk per worker and await every chunk.
- **Runtime control.** `resize()`, `pause()` / `resume()`, `wait()`, `wait_for()`
  and a graceful `shutdown()` that drains the queue.
- **Thread-safe submission.** `submit()` can be called concurrently from any
  number of threads.
- **No dangling futures.** The submitting entry points are constrained to lvalue
  pools, so `tutti::ThreadPool(4).submit(f)` is a compile error rather than a
  future tied to a destroyed pool.

## Requirements

- A C++23 compiler and standard library. CI builds and runs the test suite with
  `-DTUTTI_WERROR=ON` on every combination below, so these are verified, not
  inferred:

  | Toolchain | Standard library |
  | --- | --- |
  | GCC 14.2, GCC 15.2 | libstdc++ |
  | Clang 19.1, Clang 20.1 | libstdc++ 14 |
  | AppleClang 21 (Xcode 26), Homebrew LLVM 20.1 | libc++ |
  | MSVC 14.44 (Visual Studio 2022), 14.51 (Visual Studio 2026) | MSVC STL |
  | MinGW-w64 GCC 16.2 (UCRT64) | libstdc++ |

- C++23 mode: `-std=c++23` on GCC and Clang, `/std:c++23preview` or
  `/std:c++latest` on MSVC.
- AddressSanitizer with UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, and ThreadSanitizer, both
  under GCC on Linux.
- CMake 3.20+ if you want to use the CMake build.

### Portability notes

Two C++23 library features Tutti uses are still missing from libc++, Apple's
included. Tutti detects both at build time and degrades instead of failing:

- No `<stacktrace>`. Task provenance in `task_history()` is disabled,
  `tutti::StackTrace` is an empty type, and `tutti::has_stacktrace` is `false`.
- No `std::move_only_function`. `tutti::MoveOnlyFunction` falls back to an
  equivalent move-only, type-erased wrapper. No public API changes.

Clang 18 and earlier cannot build Tutti against libstdc++ at all: they report
`__cpp_concepts` as `201907L`, and libstdc++'s `<expected>` requires `202002L`.
Clang 19 is the first release that reports `202002L`.

## Getting started

Drop `include/tutti/thread_pool.hpp` into your project, or build it with CMake:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(Tutti)
target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE tutti::tutti)
```

Build and run the tests and examples:

```sh
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

## Usage

### Submitting work

`submit()` forwards its arguments into `std::invoke`, so anything callable is
accepted. The returned future carries both the result and any exception.

```cpp
tutti::ThreadPool pool(4);

// A value-returning task.
std::future<int> answer = pool.submit([] { return 42; });

// A task with arguments.
auto product = pool.submit([](int a, int b) { return a * b; }, 6, 7);

// A member function, with the object passed explicitly.
struct Counter { int value = 0; int add(int by) { return value += by; } };
Counter counter;
auto sum = pool.submit(&Counter::add, &counter, 5);

// A move-only callable: nothing in the path has to be copyable.
auto owned = std::make_unique<int>(21);
auto doubled = pool.submit([value = std::move(owned)] { return *value * 2; });
```

`submit()` is `[[nodiscard]]` on purpose: a discarded future silently swallows
the task's exception. If you really want fire-and-forget, say so:

```cpp
static_cast<void>(pool.submit([] { /* ... */ }));
```

### Refusing work without exceptions

`try_submit()` returns `std::expected<std::future<R>, tutti::PoolError>`:

```cpp
tutti::ThreadPool pool(tutti::ThreadPool::Options{.thread_count = 4, .max_pending = 1024});

if (auto accepted = pool.try_submit([] { return 7; })) {
    std::println("result = {}", accepted->get());
} else {
    std::println("refused: {}", accepted.error());   // "stopped" or "queue_full"
}
```

### Bulk work

```cpp
std::vector<int> data(1'000'000, 1);

// One chunk per worker, every chunk awaited before returning.
pool.parallel_for_each(data, [](int& value) { value = 2; });

// The same for an index range. The counter is shared, so it has to be atomic.
std::atomic<std::size_t> twos{0};
pool.parallel_for(std::size_t{0}, data.size(), [&data, &twos](std::size_t index) {
    if (data[index] == 2) {
        twos.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    }
});
```

If a chunk throws, the remaining chunks are still awaited and the first exception
is rethrown to the caller. If a submission fails (for example, the bounded queue
is full), every already accepted chunk is awaited before that submission error
is rethrown, keeping the shared callback alive throughout.

### Exceptions

```cpp
auto failing = pool.submit([]() -> int { throw std::runtime_error("nope"); });
try {
    (void)failing.get();
} catch (const std::runtime_error& error) {
    std::println("caught: {}", error.what());
}
```

### Waiting for results

```cpp
pool.wait();                                        // until every task has finished
if (!pool.wait_for(std::chrono::seconds(1))) {      // or until a deadline
    // still busy
}
```

Do not call `wait()`, `wait_for()`, `shutdown()` or `parallel_for()` from inside
a task: the pool would be waiting for work that can only finish on the thread
doing the waiting. Submitting from inside a task is fine.

`wait()` and `wait_for()` observe the pool becoming idle. Concurrent submissions
can extend the wait; these calls do not capture a snapshot of earlier work.

### Controlling the pool

```cpp
pool.resize(8);      // grow or shrink at run time
pool.pause();        // suspend execution; queued tasks stay queued
pool.resume();       // continue
pool.shutdown();     // stop accepting work, drain the queue, join every worker
```

Shrinking a pool never interrupts a running task: a retiring worker finishes what
it is doing and then exits.

### Observing and formatting

`PoolStats` has a `std::formatter`, and the pool can report where its most recent
submissions came from.

```cpp
std::println("{}", pool.stats());
// threads=4 idle=4 active=0 pending=0 completed=15 max_pending=0 state=running

// WorkerInfo carries a std::thread::id, which compares but has no
// std::formatter, so print it through a stream if you need it.
std::println("{} workers", pool.workers().size());

for (const tutti::TaskRecord& record : pool.task_history()) {
    const std::string frame =
        record.origin.empty() ? std::string("<none>") : record.origin[0].description();
    std::println("task #{} from {}", record.sequence, frame);
}
```

`task_history()` is empty unless `Options::trace_depth` is non-zero, because
capturing a `std::stacktrace` on every submission is not free. Symbol names in
the frames need debug information in the binary; without it the frames carry
module offsets.

## API

| Member | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ThreadPool()` | Creates a pool sized from `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`. |
| `ThreadPool(n)` | Creates a pool with `n` workers, clamped to `[1, 4096]`. |
| `ThreadPool(Options)` | Thread count, queue limit and tracing depth. |
| `submit(f, args...)` | Enqueues a task and returns `std::future<R>`. Throws when refused. |
| `try_submit(f, args...)` | Same, but returns `std::expected<std::future<R>, PoolError>`. |
| `parallel_for(first, last, f)` | Runs `f` over an index range across the workers. |
| `parallel_for_each(range, f)` | Runs `f` over a random-access range. |
| `resize(n)` / `try_resize(n)` | Grows or shrinks the pool. |
| `pause()` / `resume()` | Suspends or resumes task execution. |
| `wait()` / `wait_for(d)` | Blocks until all submitted tasks have finished. |
| `shutdown()` | Stops the pool and drains the queue. Idempotent. |
| `thread_count()` | Number of workers owned by the pool. |
| `idle_count()` | Workers not currently executing a task. |
| `active_count()` | Tasks currently executing. |
| `pending_count()` | Tasks waiting in the queue. |
| `completed_count()` | Tasks finished since the pool was created. |
| `max_pending()` | Configured queue limit, or 0 when unbounded. |
| `state()` | `State::running`, `State::paused` or `State::draining`. |
| `paused()` / `stopped()` | Convenience state queries. |
| `stats()` | Every counter in one consistent snapshot. |
| `workers()` | Index and `std::thread::id` of every worker. |
| `task_history()` | Most recent submissions with their call sites. |
| `default_thread_count()` | Hardware concurrency, or 1 if unavailable. |

## C++23 features used

| Feature | Where |
| --- | --- |
| `std::move_only_function` | the task queue, so a task never has to be copyable (a fallback covers libc++, see the portability notes) |
| `std::expected` | `try_submit()`, `try_resize()` |
| Explicit object parameter (`this Self&&`) | `submit()`, `try_submit()`, `parallel_for()`, `parallel_for_each()` require an lvalue pool |
| `std::format` + `std::formatter` | `to_string(PoolStats)` and the `PoolStats` formatter |
| `std::print` / `std::println` | the example |
| `[[assume]]` | `clamp_thread_count()` and `parallel_for()`, on compilers that implement it |
| `std::unreachable` | the exhaustive switches in `to_string()` |
| `std::to_underlying` | the numeric state code in `to_string(PoolStats)` |
| `std::stacktrace` | optional task provenance in `task_history()` |
| `std::jthread` + `std::stop_token` (C++20) | worker lifetime and cooperative retirement |

C++26 was probed and deliberately not used: the toolchain this was developed on
does not implement the parts that would help a thread pool. `= delete("reason")`,
`#embed`, pack indexing, contracts, `std::hive`, `std::inplace_vector`,
`std::simd`, `std::execution` senders and `std::optional<T&>` are all absent, and
the C++26 library additions that do exist are unrelated to scheduling. Building
with `/std:c++latest` works and reports `__cplusplus == 202400`, but nothing in
Tutti needs it.

## Design notes

The first version of this library was written against C++11 and showed its age.
Tutti keeps the useful parts of that API and rebuilds the rest:

| Concern | Before | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Waiting for completion | `while (work_thread_num) {}` busy-wait | `std::condition_variable` |
| Worker lifetime | `std::thread` plus manual `join` / `detach` | `std::jthread`, joined automatically |
| Cancellation | a `std::vector<bool>` of stop flags | `std::stop_token` |
| Exceptions | a throwing task could take down a worker | captured in the task's future |
| Task storage | `std::function` plus a `shared_ptr<packaged_task>` | `std::move_only_function` holding the `packaged_task` directly |
| Refusals | only exceptions | `std::expected`, and an optional queue bound |
| `resize()` | could drop or duplicate workers | spawns or retires the exact delta |
| Header hygiene | `using namespace std;` at global scope | fully qualified, self-contained header |
| Detach semantics | a `freedom_pool` flag that leaked threads | removed; the destructor drains and joins |

A few implementation details worth knowing:

- Tasks are type-erased into a move-only callable (`tutti::MoveOnlyFunction<void()>`,
  which is `std::move_only_function` where available). The concrete callable lives
  inside a `std::packaged_task`, which is what gives every task a future and lets
  the queue hold move-only callables without an indirection.
- The lifecycle is a single `State` value (`running`, `paused`, `draining`)
  instead of three independent booleans, so the transitions are exhaustive and
  the state is always consistent with the worker list.
- `shutdown()` switches to `draining` instead of stopping workers immediately, so
  queued work is finished rather than dropped.
- Control-plane calls (`resize`, `pause`, `resume`, `wait`, `shutdown`) are not
  meant to race with each other. `submit()` and `try_submit()` are fully
  concurrent.
- The header carries two targeted suppressions, both documented in place: an
  empty `catch` that keeps a worker alive, and a `clang-analyzer` false positive
  about `workers_` being moved from. See `.clang-tidy` for the static-analysis
  policy.
